What is Lorem Ipsum?Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing andtypesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only fivecenturies, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentiallyunchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheetscontaining Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishingsoftware like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do weuse it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by thereadable content of a page when looking at its layout.The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposedto using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum astheir default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover manyweb sites still in their infancy. Various versionshave evolved over the years,sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simplyrandom text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor atHampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one ofthe more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classicalliterature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. Thefirst line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a linein section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exactoriginal form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.Rackham.Where can I get some?There are many variations of passages of LoremIpsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, byinjected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.If you are going to use a passage ofLorem Ipsum, you need to be sure thereisn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the LoremIpsumgenerators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary ofover 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, togenerate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum istherefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristicwords etc.The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s"Lorem ipsumdolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididuntut labore et dolore magna aliqua.Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrudexercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Rackham"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and Iwill give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actualteachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of humanhappiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because itis pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationallyencounter consequences that are extremely painful.Nor again is there anyone wholoves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, butbecauseoccasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure himsome great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakeslaborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But whohas anyright to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that hasno annoying consequences, or one who avoidsa pain that produces no resultantpleasure?"Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Ciceroin 45 BC"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus quiblanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores etquas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similiquesunt in culpaqui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorumfuga.

Nam liberotempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minusid quod maxime placeatfacere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnisdolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis autrerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum  hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis v  oluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis dolori  busasperiores repellat."1914 translation by H. Rackham"On the oth  er hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are   so beguiled and demoralized by thecharms of pleasure of the moment, so bli   nded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are boundtoensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as sayingthrough shr inking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when ourpower of choice is untramm elled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is tobe welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,orelse he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
